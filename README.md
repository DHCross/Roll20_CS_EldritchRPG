This repository serves as a platform for seeking assistance in creating a custom character sheet for Eldritch RPG, 2nd Edition. The goal is to develop a functional and visually appealing character sheet tailored to the mechanics and requirements of the Eldritch RPG system.

Description

The current implementation includes two sections: abilities and calculations. However, further development is needed to complete the sheet and make it fully functional.

Abilities
